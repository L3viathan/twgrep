twgrep
======

Search through your tweets

What grep is for arbitrary text, and Tgrep2 is for syntax trees, twgrep aims to be for tweet archives.

Installation
------------

Simply drop twgrep into your tweets/data/js/tweets directory (from the archive you can download on twitter.com), and you're done.

Usage
-----

If you want an overview of the available options, run `twgrep.py -h`

You can search for tweets containing certain words, matching a regular expression, replying to or mentioning someone, from a specific client, or at a certain date/month/year. By default, twgrep prints the text of every tweet on a new line, but the output format is configurable.
